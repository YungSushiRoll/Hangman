    <p id="rules">
        A random 80's/90's "band" name will be chosen, the "band" name to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. You start guessing
        by pressing any letter on your keyboard. Instead of obtaining limbs on your Hangman, it's similar to the game of
        Horse, every time you choose an incorrect letter you will be given a letter. Once you have reached 7 incorrect
        guesses or spelled the word "HANGMAN" you Lose. You win by correctly guessing the "band" name. After your 3rd
        incorrect guess you will be given the option to receive a HINT. The HINT should make guessing easier! Good Luck!
